# MMM Enhanced Model
This project builds a more realistic Marketing Mix Model by combining hierarchical Bayesian inference, causal calibration, and time-varying media effects. I generated synthetic marketing data with adstock, saturation, seasonal patterns, synergy across channels, and external shocks, then fit a Bayesian MMM in PyMC to recover the true parameters. To make the model more credible and interpretable, I incorporated experimental lift estimates as informative priors and added a dynamic component that allows media effectiveness to evolve over time. I evaluated the model through parameter recovery and rolling time-series validation, and found that causal priors improved accuracy and that dynamic coefficients helped capture shifts in channel performance. Overall, the goal is to bring MMM closer to real-world behavior by grounding it in causal evidence and time-varying effects rather than relying only on static assumptions.
